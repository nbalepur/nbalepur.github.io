# Personal Research Website

A single-page personal website built with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Add your photo to `public/assets/photo.jpg` (or update the path in `src/components/Sidebar.jsx`)

3. Update the contact links in `src/components/Sidebar.jsx`:
   - Google Scholar URL
   - Twitter URL  
   - Email address

4. Update your name and content in the components

5. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

6. Build for production:
```bash
npm run build
```

## Structure

- `src/App.jsx` - Main app component
- `src/components/Sidebar.jsx` - Left sidebar with photo, name, and contact buttons
- `public/assets/` - Static assets (images, etc.)

## Tech Stack

- **React 18** - UI library for interactive components
- **Vite** - Fast build tool and dev server
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework
