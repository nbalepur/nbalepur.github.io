Three papers on LLM MCQA reasoning accepted to ACL 2024 (1 main, 1 findings, 1 KnowLM workshop)! We see if LLMs can [answer MCQA questions without the question](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12483) (main); 2) [perform process of elimination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07532) (findings); and 3) [cheat on MCQA leaderboards](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2407.01992) (KnowLM workshop)
