Two oral papers at NAACL 2025 (main)! One work shows [LLMs are surprisingly weak at generating accurate questions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15512) [[slides](https://nbalepur.github.io/assets/pdf/naacl_rqa.pdf)], while my Adobe internship project builds a [multi-agent summarization model for debatable queries](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2502.00322) [[slides](https://nbalepur.github.io/assets/pdf/naacl_mods.pdf)]
