<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <p>Hello! My name is Nishant and Iâ€™m a first-year Ph.D. student in the <strong>CLIP Lab</strong> at the University of Maryland, where I am fortunate to be advised by <strong>Professor <a href="http://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~jbg/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Jordan Boyd-Grayber</a></strong>. As of 2023, I am extremely thankful to be funded by the <a href="https://www.nsfgrfp.org/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">NSF GRFP</a>.</p> <p>I am fascinated with the intersection of language, information, and AI safety in natural language processing. I am especially passionate about developing frameworks that align with <strong>human values</strong>, with a focus on <strong>truthfulness</strong> in text generation, <strong>human-centered</strong> language technologies, and language model <strong>safety</strong>. Currently, I am developing methods to align LLMs for educational applications and to equip LLMs with more interpretable reasoning.</p> <p>Before UMD, I obtained my B.S. in Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where I had the pleasure to collaborate with Professors <a href="https://cs.illinois.edu/about/people/faculty/kcchang" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Kevin Chang</a>, <a href="http://hanj.cs.illinois.edu/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Jiawei Han</a>, <a href="http://sundaram.cs.illinois.edu/research.html" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Hari Sundaram</a>, and <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/~diyiy/group.html" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Diyi Yang</a>, and recieved great mentorship from graduate students <a href="https://jeffhj.github.io/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Jie Huang</a> and <a href="https://shivamag125.github.io/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Shivam Agarwal</a>.</p> <p>See my (possibly outdated) CV <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/read/brzntgpfnvtx" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.
