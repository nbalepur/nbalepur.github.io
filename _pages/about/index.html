<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <p>Hello! My name is Nishant and Iâ€™m a first-year Computer Science Ph.D. student at the University of Maryland, College Park. I am a member of the <a href="https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/clip/index.php/Main_Page" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Computational Linguistics and Information Processing (CLIP)</a> Lab, currently working with Professors <a href="http://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~jbg/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Jordan Boyd-Grayber</a> and <a href="https://rudinger.github.io/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Rachel Rudinger</a>. I am extremely thankful to be funded by the <a href="https://www.nsfgrfp.org/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">NSF GRFP</a> as of 2023.</p> <p>I am fascinated with the intersection of language, information, and AI safety in natural language processing. I am especially passionate about developing frameworks that align with human values, with a focus on factuality and truthfulness in text generation, socially aware and human-centered language technologies, and language model safety.</p> <p>Before UMD, I obtained my B.S. in Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where I primarily worked with Professor <a href="https://cs.illinois.edu/about/people/faculty/kcchang" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Kevin Chang</a> and his Ph.D. student <a href="https://jeffhj.github.io/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Jie Huang</a>. I have also had the pleasure to collaborate with Professors <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/~diyiy/group.html" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Diyi Yang</a>, <a href="http://hanj.cs.illinois.edu/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Jiawei Han</a>, and <a href="http://sundaram.cs.illinois.edu/research.html" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Hari Sundaram</a>. My undergraduate senior thesis was titled: <em>Aligning Language Models with Factuality and Truthfulness</em>, which can be viewed <a href="https://nbalepur.github.io/files/Nishant_Balepur_Senior_Thesis.pdf">here</a>.</p> <p>See my (possibly outdated) CV <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/read/brzntgpfnvtx" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">here</a>. If you have any questions about research, NSF, or anything else, please reach out!</p> </body></html>
