Hi! My name is Nishant and I'm a second-year Ph.D. student at the University of Maryland, where I am fortunate to be advised by Professors **[Jordan Boyd-Grayber](http://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~jbg/)** and **[Rachel Rudinger](https://rudinger.github.io/)**. I also collaborate closely with Professor **[Shi Feng](https://ihsgnef.github.io/)** at GWU. I am graciously supported by the [NSF GRFP](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) and a [Cohere For AI Research Grant](https://cohere.com/blog/c4ai-research-grants).

I am (super broadly) working on aligning and evaluating LLMs (or [Muppets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0DgoRVLTE8)). My research can be grouped into 3 questions: 
1. How can we make models more **factual**?
   [[expository text (EMNLP'23)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03276), [fact transfer (EMNLP'23)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14486), [debates](https://www.overleaf.com/read/dtxqnwnnkppb#5c4b79)]
2. How can we guide models toward **downstream user goals**?
   [[topic mining (ACL'23)](https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-acl.14/), [flashcards (EMNLP'24)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12291), [mnemonics (EMNLP'24)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15352)]
3. How can evaluations expose model and dataset **weaknesses**?
   [[process of elimination (ACL'24)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07532), [mcqa artifacts (ACL'24)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12483), [benchmark cheating (ACL'24)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01992), [mcqa plausibility (EMNLP'24)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10854), [reverse qa](https://www.overleaf.com/read/gnzjpxvsppdb#b89f87)]
