Hi! My name is Nishant and I'm a second-year Ph.D. student at the University of Maryland, where I am fortunate to be advised by Professors **[Jordan Boyd-Grayber](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~jbg/)** and **[Rachel Rudinger](https://rudinger.github.io/)**. I am graciously supported by the [NSF GRFP](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) and a [Cohere For AI Research Grant](https://cohere.com/blog/c4ai-research-grants).

I semi-jokingly say that I work on bullying (evaluating flaws) and babysitting (alignment) in [LLMs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0DgoRVLTE8). I'm currently excited about the three research questions: 
1. How can we better synthesize **factual** sources?
   [[topic mining (ACL'23)](https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-acl.14/), [expository text (EMNLP'23)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03276), [fact transfer (EMNLP'23)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14486), [debatable queries (NAACL'25)](https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2502.00322)]
2. How can we teach models to **help users**?
   [[flashcards (EMNLP'24)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12291), [mnemonics (EMNLP'24)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15352), [personalized dpo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11549)]
3. How can we build evaluations to expose **model/dataset flaws**?
   [[process of elimination (ACL'24)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07532), [mcqa artifacts (ACL'24)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12483), [benchmark cheating (ACL'24)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01992), [mcqa plausibility (EMNLP'24)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10854), [reverse qa (NAACL'25)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15512), [mcqa is flawed](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14127)]

I'm generally interested in research that is useful (helps users) and fun (with entertaining outputs to look at). If you're interested in similar problems, don't hesitate to [reach out!](mailto:nbalepur@umd.edu)

And if you've seen another "Balepur, N" during your literature search, you may be looking for [my sister](https://nainasb.github.io/) ðŸ˜›
