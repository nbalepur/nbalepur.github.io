Hello! My name is Nishant and I'm a first-year Computer Science Ph.D. student at the University of Maryland, College Park. I am a member of the [Computational Linguistics and Information Processing (CLIP)](https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/clip/index.php/Main_Page) Lab, currently working with Professors [Jordan Boyd-Grayber](http://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~jbg/) and [Rachel Rudinger](https://rudinger.github.io/). I am extremely thankful to be funded by the [NSF GRFP](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) as of 2023.

I am fascinated with the intersection of language, information, and AI safety in natural language processing. I am especially passionate about developing frameworks that align with human values, with a focus on factuality and truthfulness in text generation, socially aware and human-centered language technologies, and language model safety.

Before UMD, I obtained my B.S. in Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where I primarily worked with Professor [Kevin Chang](https://cs.illinois.edu/about/people/faculty/kcchang) and his Ph.D. student [Jie Huang](https://jeffhj.github.io/). I have also had the pleasure to collaborate with Professors [Diyi Yang](https://cs.stanford.edu/~diyiy/group.html), [Jiawei Han](http://hanj.cs.illinois.edu/), and [Hari Sundaram](http://sundaram.cs.illinois.edu/research.html). My undergraduate senior thesis was titled: *Aligning Language Models with Factuality and Truthfulness*, which can be viewed [here](https://nbalepur.github.io/files/Nishant_Balepur_Senior_Thesis.pdf).

See my (possibly outdated) CV [here](https://www.overleaf.com/read/brzntgpfnvtx). If you have any questions about research, NSF, or anything else, please reach out!
