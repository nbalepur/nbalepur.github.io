Hi! My name is Nishant and I'm a third-year Ph.D. candidate at the University of Maryland, where I am fortunate to be advised by Professors **[Jordan Boyd-Grayber](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~jbg/)** and **[Rachel Rudinger](https://rudinger.github.io/)**. I'm currently interning with [Ai2](https://allenai.org/) to personalize [ScholarQA](https://scholarqa.allen.ai/chat) and visiting [NYU](https://cims.nyu.edu/dynamic/) as a researcher with [Eunsol Choi](https://eunsol.github.io/).

I mostly work on alignment (rewards beyond preferences) and evaluation (metrics beyond correctness) to make LLM responses more helpful. I'm currently excited about three research questions, in descending order of excitement: 
1. How can we build systems that **help** users?
   [[flashcards (EMNLP'24)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12291), [memorable study aids (EMNLP'24)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15352), [personalized dpo (ACL'25)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11549), [multi-step plans (EMNLP'25)](https://nbalepur.github.io/assets/pdf/Planorama.pdf)]
2. How can we rigorously build **evaluations** to expose model flaws?
   [[eliminative reasoning (ACL'24)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07532), [mcqa artifacts (ACL'24)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12483), [benchmark cheating (ACL'24)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01992), [mcqa plausibility (EMNLP'24)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10854), [abductive reasoning (NAACL'25)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15512), [mcqa generally sucks (ACL'25)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14127)]
3. How can we synthesize **factual** sources?
   [[topic mining (ACL'23)](https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-acl.14/), [expository text (EMNLP'23)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03276), [fact transfer (EMNLP'23)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14486), [debatable queries (NAACL'25)](https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2502.00322)]

I'm generally interested in research that is useful for humans and fun to read. If you're interested in similar problems, don't hesitate to [reach out!](mailto:nbalepur@umd.edu)

And if you've seen another "Balepur, N" during your literature search, you may be looking for [my sister](https://nainasb.github.io/) ðŸ˜›
