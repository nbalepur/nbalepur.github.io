Hi! My name is Nishant and I'm a first-year Ph.D. student at the University of Maryland, where I am fortunate to be advised by Professors **[Jordan Boyd-Grayber](http://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~jbg/)** and **[Rachel Rudinger](https://rudinger.github.io/)**. My work is graciously supported by the [NSF GRFP](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) and a [Cohere For AI Research Grant](https://cohere.com/blog/c4ai-research-grants).

I am currently working on aligning, interpreting, and guiding LLMs (or [Muppets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0DgoRVLTE8)). My research can broadly be grouped into three questions: 
1. How can we make models more **factual**?
   [[EMNLP 2023a](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03276), [EMNLP 2023b](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14486)]
2. How can we align models to **downstream user goals**?
   [[ACL 2023](https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-acl.14/), [Arxiv 2024a](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12291), [Arxiv 2024b](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15352)]
3. How can we probe the **weaknesses** and **capabilities** of models?
   [[ACL 2024a](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07532), [ACL 2024b](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12483), [KnowledgeLM @ ACL 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01992)]
