Hello! My name is Nishant and I'm a first-year Ph.D. student in the **CLIP Lab** at the University of Maryland, where I am fortunate to be advised by **Professors [Jordan Boyd-Grayber](http://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~jbg/)** and **[Rachel Rudinger](https://rudinger.github.io/)**. As of 2023, I am extremely thankful to be funded by the [NSF GRFP](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/).

I am interested in aligning, interpreting, and guiding [Muppet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0DgoRVLTE8)/LLM outputs. My research can broadly be grouped into three questions: 
1. Can we make model outputs more **factual**?
   [[EMNLP 2023a](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03276), [EMNLP 2023b](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14486)]
2. How can **users guide** model outputs?
   [[ACL 2023](https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-acl.14/), [Arxiv 2024a](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12291)]
3. How can we **interpret** the **safety** and **reliability** of model outputs?
   [[Arxiv 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07532), [Arxiv 2024b](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12483)]

I also love discovering unconventional/out-of-domain model weaknesses and subsequently designing frameworks to overcome these issues or probe why they happen. As a result, a lot of my research starts with an observation after trying to break current models.

If you are looking for research experience (especially UMD students), or have any questions about NSF or anything else, please [reach out](mailto:nbalepur@umd.edu)!
