Hi! My name is Nishant and I'm a ~~first-year~~ ~~second-year~~ ~~I'll stop counting~~ Ph.D. student at the University of Maryland, where I am fortunate to be advised by **[Jordan Boyd-Grayber](http://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~jbg/)** and **[Rachel Rudinger](https://rudinger.github.io/)**.I am graciously supported by the [NSF GRFP](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) and a [Cohere For AI Grant](https://cohere.com/blog/c4ai-research-grants).

I am (super broadly) working on aligning and evaluating LLMs (or [Muppets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0DgoRVLTE8)). My research can be grouped into three questions: 
1. How can we make models more **factual**?
   [[EMNLP 2023a](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03276), [EMNLP 2023b](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14486)]
2. How can we guide models toward **downstream user goals**?
   [[ACL 2023](https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-acl.14/), [Arxiv 2024a](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12291), [Arxiv 2024b](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15352)]
3. How can we better evaluate model **weaknesses** and **capabilities**?
   [[ACL 2024a](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07532), [ACL 2024b](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12483), [ACL 2024c](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01992)]
