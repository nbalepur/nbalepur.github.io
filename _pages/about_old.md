Hello! My name is Nishant and I'm a first-year Ph.D. student in the **CLIP Lab** at the University of Maryland, where I am fortunate to be advised by **Professors [Jordan Boyd-Grayber](http://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~jbg/)** and **[Rachel Rudinger](https://rudinger.github.io/)**. As of 2023, I am extremely thankful to be funded by the [NSF GRFP](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/).

I am fascinated with the intersection of language, information, and AI safety. I am especially passionate about designing frameworks that align with **human values**, with a focus on:
1. **factuality** in text generation [[EMNLP 2023a](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03276), [EMNLP 2023b](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14486)]
2. **human-centered** and **guided** models [[ACL 2023](https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-acl.14/), [Arxiv 2024a](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12291)]
3. **[Muppet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0DgoRVLTE8)** (LLM) **safety** and **interpretability** [[Arxiv 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07532), [Arxiv 2024b](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12483)]
   
Currently, I am developing methods to align Muppets for educational applications and to understand the decision-making capabilities of Muppets.

Before UMD, I obtained my B.S. in Computer Science and Statistics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where I had the pleasure to collaborate with Professors [Kevin Chang](https://cs.illinois.edu/about/people/faculty/kcchang), [Jiawei Han](http://hanj.cs.illinois.edu/), [Hari Sundaram](http://sundaram.cs.illinois.edu/research.html), and [Diyi Yang](https://cs.stanford.edu/~diyiy/group.html), and recieved great mentorship from graduate students [Jie Huang](https://jeffhj.github.io/) and [Shivam Agarwal](https://shivamag125.github.io/).

If you are looking for research experience (especially UMD students), or have any questions about NSF or anything else, please [reach out](mailto:nbalepur@umd.edu)!
